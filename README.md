TBStartAllJoyn
==============

http://higgns.com/tbstartalljoyn


Dependencies
============

1. A platform appropriate download of the AllJoyn SDK from https://allseenalliance.org/developers/download

2. Build process appropriate to your platform that can include/link the AllJoyn headers/libs


Usage
=====

After setting up the build appropriately, you can copy/paste the TBStartAllJoyn.h/cpp into a larger project, or simply start
hacking away at the example.cpp to play around with different Events and Actions.

There are some platform specific implementation details that might be relevant, but you can get away with just stubbing a lot
of the data and focus on functionality to start with.
