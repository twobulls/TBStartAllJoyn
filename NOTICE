To simplify the prototyping of an AllJoyn enabled device. Ideally with minimal knowledge of AllJoyn itself, you will
be able to start a service advertising on an AllJoyn network be further able to interact with that service as per
the customized functionality being prototyped. As a particular use case, this will enable a device to be visible and
interactable with Higgns (www.higgns.com).

Some basic concepts:

	* AllJoyn Router/Daemon - the device wide mechanism by which network comms are established between devices in an AllJoyn context.
	* BusObject(Helper) - the customized implementation class that provides the prototyped interface that gets proxied to other peers.
	* Event - an outgoing Signal with a human readable description that can be used as a trigger.
	* Action - a callable Method with a human readable description that can be used to implement behaviour. 

This example wraps up the complexity of setting up an appropriate configured BusObject by making some simplifying assumptions
and that allows very fast prototyping of a functional AllJoyn enabled device.
